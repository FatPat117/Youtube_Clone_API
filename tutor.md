### Process Flows

1. **Authentication Flow**:

      - Client sends credentials
      - Server validates user
      - JWT tokens are generated and returned
      - Protected routes use token for authentication

2. **Video Upload Flow**:

      - Video and thumbnail files are uploaded to Cloudinary
      - Metadata is stored in MongoDB
      - Video is associated with the user

3. **Comment System Flow**:

      - Comments are linked to videos and users
      - Nested comments are supported through parent references
      - Comments can be liked, updated, or deleted

4. **Subscription Flow**:
      - Users can subscribe to other users' channels
      - Subscription status determines content visibility
      - Subscription counts are tracked for analytics
